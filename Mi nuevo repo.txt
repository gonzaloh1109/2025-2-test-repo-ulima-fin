"Lorem ipsum" is a nonsensical, placeholder text used in graphic design, publishing, and web development to demonstrate the visual layout of a page or design without the distraction of meaningful content. It's a scrambled version of a Latin text by Cicero, with the first two words, "dolorem ipsum," meaning "pain itself". While it mimics the appearance of Latin, the text is intentionally meaningless to allow designers to focus on the visual elements of a project, such as typography and layout.
